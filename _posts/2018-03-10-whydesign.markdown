Designing IdeaMapr was the best part of creating a startup. The parts of UX that I did at Granicus were also the most fun. I think there is a lot of what I like about product management in design. Thinking about the user, researching, imagining how the the tools can actually help the user solve whatever issue they are working with. I am also very visually minded. I think in pictures and being able to find ways to express my thoughts visually appeals to me.

Working remotely is also very important to me and I think design would be me a greater opportunity to do that. There are few PM jobs and companies usually want the PM to work from the office even if they will allow designers and engineers on the same team to work remotely. There are also more design spots available than pm jobs.

There are also other downsides to product management that I would hope that design does not have. The PM is responsible for the product but not in control of the people who make the product. The PM is responsible for the input of the people who make the product and the outcomes of the product but can only direct the product team via influence. I absolutely hate this about being a PM. I hate the idea that everyone is supposed to be each other’s friends on the product team and the executives are everyone’s friends because really the executives are the ones who sign the checks and I don’t, so it really comes down to influence, I’m not as influential. I don’t want to have to influence people to do their job, especially when my whole performance is determined solely by what they produce.
As a designer, I would not be able to lead the direction of the product like I would as a PM, but I could at least focus on my tasks and have the direct ability to affect the outcome of my work.
